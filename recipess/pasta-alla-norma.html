    <h1>PASTA ALLA NORMA</h1>
    <img src="../images/pasta.jpg">
    <p>Pasta alla Norma is a classic Sicilian pasta dish known for its rich and hearty flavors. It typically consists of pasta, often rigatoni or spaghetti, served with a sauce made from sautéed eggplant, tomatoes, garlic, basil, and sometimes a touch of red pepper flakes for a hint of spice. The dish is usually finished with a generous sprinkling of grated ricotta salata cheese, which adds a unique, slightly salty flavor to complement the sweet and savory elements of the sauce. Pasta alla Norma is a delightful representation of Sicilian cuisine and a favorite among those who appreciate Mediterranean flavors.</p>

    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <OL>
        <li><p>Slice the eggplant about ½ inch thick. Cook in abundant olive oil, without crowding, sprinkling with salt and adding more oil as needed. You will undoubtedly have to cook in batches; take your time and cook until the eggplant is nicely browned and soft. Remove to a plate; do not drain on paper towels. Meanwhile, put a large pot of water to boil and salt it.</p></li>
        <li><p>At the end of the cooking the eggplant, the pan will ideally have a couple of tablespoons of oil left. If there’s more or less, drain some off or add a bit. Turn the heat to medium, add the garlic and chiles, and cook until the garlic colors a little bit. Add the tomatoes and oregano, along with some salt and pepper; cook until saucy but not too dry, stirring occasionally.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cook the pasta until tender but not mushy. While it’s cooking, cut the eggplant into strips and reheat for a minute in the tomato sauce. Drain the pasta and toss it with the tomato sauce and the eggplant. Taste and adjust the seasoning, then top with the parsley or basil and grated cheese and serve.</p></li>
