    <h1>CHILLI OIL</h1>
    <img src="../images/chilli.jpg">
    <p>Chili oil, also known as hot chili oil or chili-infused oil, is a condiment commonly used in various cuisines, particularly in Asian cooking. It is made by heating oil (typically vegetable oil) and infusing it with dried chili peppers and sometimes other flavor-enhancing ingredients like garlic, ginger, and spices. The heat level of chili oil can vary widely, depending on the type and quantity of chili peppers used.</p>

    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>There are many differing opinions when it comes to the best aromatics for chili oil, as well as many variations. In the years since I first posted this recipe, I’ve experimented with more variations, and have outlined some additions you can use, as well as the bare minimum you’ll need to make a great chili oil. </p></li>
        <li><p>Place oil and selected aromatics into a pot with at least two inches of clearance between the oil and the rim of the pot. If using minimum aromatics, 1 ½ cups of oil should do it. If using all the aromatics, you can add up to 3 cups of oil. </p></li>
        <li><p>While the oil is infusing, prepare your chili flakes by placing them in a heatproof bowl.</p></li>
